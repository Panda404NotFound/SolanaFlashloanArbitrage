Run the following command in your terminal to install Solana CLI

sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
Bash
You have the option to substitute "stable" with the release tag that corresponds to the software version you want (such as v1.18.1), or you can opt for one of the three symbolic channel names: stable, beta, or edge.

Now run the following command to check the version of Solana.

solana --version
Bash
Output
